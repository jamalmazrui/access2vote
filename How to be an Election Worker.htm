<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>National Disability Voter
Registration week has come and gone, and you may be wondering what are the next
steps to make people see the power of the disability vote. One way to do this
is by making our physical presence known. A great way to remind people that we
are part of the community is by working at a polling site!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>What does an election
worker do exactly? Their primary job is to make sure the voting process (in their
precinct) runs smoothly. Their duties can range from verifying a voter’s ID/credentials,
giving out ballots, keeping track of all equipment and votes, and making sure
all voting laws are followed throughout the entire election process. A great
part of being an election worker is that you don’t have to be a government
official; the only requirement is that you are a registered voter in the county
in which you work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>What’s even better is that
you can earn money while doing this! While some counties pay different amounts,
the average wage for a poll clerk in the state of Texas, for example, is $8.50
an hour. This is a great work opportunity if you can only work part time hours,
are limited to how much money you can earn, are trying to build some job
experience, etc.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>How do you sign up? First,
contact your county elections office and let them know you would like to serve
as an election worker. You will have to attend a training for election workers
put on by the elections office. Each county may have a different way of doing
things, so be sure to ask the election office staff what next steps you need to
take.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>If you need help finding
the election office’s contact information, you should visit the website of the
Secretary of State <span style='background:yellow'>[INSERT WEB LINK TO SOS]</span>
in your state to find the contact information for each county’s election office.
You can also talk to a staff person at your local independent living center to
see if they can help you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Should you have any more
questions about voting, please call the [ORGANIZATION] at [PHONE].</span></p>
