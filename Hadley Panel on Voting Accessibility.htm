<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Hadley Presents: Voting
Accessibility</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Presented by Rick Enger</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>December 17, 2019</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Ricky Enger:     Welcome
to Hadley Presents. I'm your host Ricky Enger, inviting you to sit back, relax
and enjoy a conversation with the experts. In this episode we conduct a panel
discussion on voting with blindness or low vision. Joining me for this
discussion are Hadley learning experts, Steve Kelly, Jennifer Ottowitz, and
facilitator Judy Matsuoka. Welcome to the show. So we'll take a moment to have
you guys introduce yourselves and tell us a little about who you are. Let's
start with you, Steve.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Steven Kelley: I've
been a vision rehab therapist for 12 years, worked in an agency prior to
working for Hadley. And right now I'm a learning expert in the technology
group.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Ricky Enger:     Excellent.
And Jennifer?</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Jen Ottowitz:   Hi. I
am a senior learning expert with Hadley. I've worked here since 2013. And
worked as a vision rehab therapist before that. And taught lots of different
courses. I'm a member of the adjustment independent living and recreation team
with Hadley and I'm visually impaired myself.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Ricky Enger:     And
Judy, how about you?</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Judy Matsuoka:        I've
been a learning expert at Hadley for the last 14 years, and prior to that I was
a vision rehabilitation therapist, a university instructor, a teacher of the
visually impaired, a braille transcriber. And Jennifer and I both once had a
client who voted in the very first election that women were allowed to vote.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Ricky Enger:     Oh,
that's so cool.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Steven Kelley: Oh my
gosh. That's great.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Ricky Enger:     Wow.
And thankfully women have the right to vote and have for quite some time. And
of course if you're blind or low vision, you have the right to vote as well.
But sometimes you may not know exactly what goes into voting when you are blind
or have low vision, and how that might differ from if you previously had sight,
or how your friends and family vote. And so that's what we want to come
together today and discuss because this is such an incredibly important topic.
Judy, I know that you have lots of great questions for us all just to kind of
spark the discussion. So I'll let you kick it off.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Judy Matsuoka:        I
think one of the things to keep in mind is that most voting policies are set at
the state level, and these policies include voter identification requirements,
early voting provisions, absentee ballot restrictions, online voter
registration, and more. And these all dictate the conditions on which we as
American citizens can cast our votes in our individual states.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>So it's really up to
each voter to know the policies of their own state. You can check by contacting
the election office in your county or your state, and in most states, that's
the secretary of state's office. Now, if you voted consistently in past years
and have not moved or changed your name, your voter registration probably does
not need to be checked. However, if you've not voted recently, be aware that
states regularly purge their roles of inactive voters and you may need to
reregister. Also, if you have moved or changed your name, you'll need to update
voter registration as well. And you can do this through the election’s office.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Ricky Enger:     It's
also worth mentioning that you can check your status online if you're not sure
if you were registered to vote. Like I had a situation where I hadn't renewed
my state ID in a number of years, and I honestly wasn't sure if I was still
registered to vote. And so there are a couple of websites like rockthevote.org,
headcount.org, and those have accessible online forms essentially that you
enter your information and can look up whether you are on the rolls for voting.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Steven Kelley: Is that
a national sort of a database?</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Ricky Enger:     It is,
yeah. And the really cool thing about rockthevote.org specifically, which is
the one that I used, is that not only can you look up to see if you're
registered to vote, but you can also find out what your polling place is.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Judy Matsuoka:        If
you talk with your election’s office too, you can also ask about getting an
absentee ballot, and to double check to find out what ID is required to vote.
We've had a spate of laws recently requiring photo IDs in many states, and so
like North Carolina, the first year that photo IDs will be required will be
2020. So you'll need to check to make sure that no policies have changed that might
affect your ability to vote. You may need to update your identification. Like
Ricky said, she hadn't updated her state ID in a while, so you may need to
update yours if it's either been a number of years or you've moved or if you've
changed your name, because you'll have to make sure that your ID matches what's
on the voter registration forms. If you have a valid driver's license, that can
be used. If not, states offer an ID to non-drivers. Sometimes those are free
and sometimes there's a fee, but if there's a fee, ask if there's a waiver
based on your age, disability, or for voting. Jennifer, doesn't Wisconsin have
special situation for the state ID?</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Jen Ottowitz:   We sure
do. Yeah. It's really nice. You can get a state ID in Wisconsin, and if you
mark on the form that you need this for voting purposes, then they waive the
normal fee.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Judy Matsuoka:        Now,
if your state allows you to vote early in person, that's the case in 38 states,
or if you wait to vote on election day, double check the location of your
polling place and it's hours. And you can do this by contacting your state or
municipal election office. And also let them know if you need an accommodation
for a disability. A friend of mine did this one time and found out that her
usual polling place was undergoing renovation and it was not going to be
wheelchair accessible. And so she called ahead, and we arranged for people to
come curbside, and so she voted from the comfort of her car. And they sent out
two polling people, one from each party, to make sure that her vote was
recorded. Sometimes things can happen last minute, so it's always good to let
them know if you need an accommodation for a disability. One constant is that
federal laws require that polling places for federal elections be accessible to
all voters, and that each polling place have a system for casting ballots
that's accessible for people with disabilities. And our panelists have had an
experience with a variety of ways to access the ballot. Steve, as a person with
low vision, would you share how you access the ballot?</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Steven Kelley: You
know, I'm somebody that does not usually ... Well I don't ever travel with a
white cane. So unless somebody is observing me using a monocular or something
like that to read a sign, they're probably not going to know that I have low
vision. So that in some ways presents kind of an interesting situation, because
the whole polling process can be a little bit challenging. So I usually walk in
there and I've got my usual pocket magnifier in one pocket. Then I've got a
larger lighted magnifier in another. And there are actually times when I
thought, I wonder what it would be like to use one of the accessible techniques
and haven't. So usually I just go up, I get the paperwork, I go to the place
where I'm filling it out, and I've got both magnifiers there, and I'm just kind
of doing this little tap dance with the ballot and trying to make sure that I
get everything in the right boxes. You know, you never know what the lighting
is going to be like in those situations. So I kind of go prepared. There've
been times when it's been a little bit tiring to be honest with you. But at the
same time I feel kind of a wimp or a poor advocate for myself because I really
don't ask the questions.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Judy Matsuoka:        I
know that advocacy is important. The friend who was able to vote curbside, she
was a wheelchair user, and all of the little curtain booths are too tall. And
so she went in there and she said, &quot;I want to use that table over
there.&quot; They ran over and they cleared the chairs out from around there.
So she went over there and then she said, &quot;Now for the next election day,
could you have like a table lamp?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Steven Kelley: You
bring up an interesting point because the irony is, Judy, if I was working with
a client, I would know much more about the process than I currently do, because
I would probably ask all of those questions and we would walk around, find
these things out in advance.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Judy Matsuoka:        One
of the things that I've noticed locally here is that most of the poll workers
are themselves mature Americans, because they're volunteers, they aren't
working regular nine to five jobs, and so they're available on election day. So
most of them are over 50, over 60. I've seen quite a few 70s and a couple of 80-year-olds
there. When we used to say things like, can we have better lighting or can we
move this one over here so it's under the overhead light, quite a few of them
would go like, oh yeah, that would make sense. So even though they were not
identifying as having a visual impairment, they still had some of the typical
needs of people who have older eyeballs.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Steven Kelley: One of
the things that we had talked about a little bit earlier was just simply access
to the voting information before getting in there. Because a lot of times
you've got community stuff that doesn't make the local news, and some
communities, their local newspapers are no longer there. And for several years
at the agency I worked at, we would get the Legal Women Voters publication and
make sure that there was a large print copy of it. And I would actually read
through the whole thing, save it as an audio file and put it on the radio
reading service. So that's another area that I think people can be a little bit
challenged by, as how do I find out what is actually going to be on the ballot,
and some of the issues.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Judy Matsuoka:        Locally
here, they often have blown up copies of the ballot, and they put them on the
wall so people can familiarize themselves while they're waiting in line. But
we've asked to have some of them loose and then that way a person with low
vision can just pick it up, and now you have a large print copy of the ballots.
So it gave people a chance to explore that a little bit more.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Jen Ottowitz:   And
here in Wisconsin you can go online and see what's on the ballot. You can at
least see the contests that are part of the ballot. Right now, I couldn't see
candidates, but our elections are not ‘til April, so maybe closer to the time,
candidates would be listed. But at least I got to see that the mayor is up for
election, the office of mayor, as well as all the other things. And I would
assume any referendums would be included there too. So you can actually check
that out online before you go to the poll to at least know what contest you're
voting on too.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Judy Matsuoka:        And
Jennifer, haven't you used a braille ballot when you voted?</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Jen Ottowitz:   Yes.
Oh, it was probably over 15 years ago, but I did use a braille ballot. They had
them available in our county for folks who were braille readers. We requested
them ahead of time, and they were in contracted braille with print also on the
ballot. And you sat at a table and read your ballot. There were pencils there
and they had a little line next to the candidate or the response, and you would
just make a mark. I don't think it really mattered what kind of mark; they were
just tallied with everyone else's vote. They're still available today. I know
personally I started using the talking voting machines once they became
available. Braille ballots are still available upon request from the election
commission. So if you are a braille reader and would prefer a braille ballot,
you might ask and see if any are available.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Judy Matsuoka:        Could
you get that braille ballot in advance of the election day?</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Jen Ottowitz:   No, no.
It was just available on election day. But you could have as much time as you
needed to read it and fill it out. So you were not in any rush.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Judy Matsuoka:        I
was just wondering if it was a way for braille readers to be able to
familiarize themselves with the ballot, and then go to the polling place and
use one of the accessible voting machines. And Ricky, you've used those
accessible voting machines too. What have been your experiences?</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Ricky Enger:     I
think there are two types of accessible voting machine, and I've used one of
them. But just in general, the concept of this accessible or talking voting
machine is that you plug in a pair of headphones. I always bring my own. There
are some there, but I either don't want to depend on that or don't necessarily
want to wear headphones that have been worn before me. So I always bring my
own. You don't necessarily have to. You'll plug those into the headphone jack.
And there are buttons of different shapes that you can press to move through
your options and select the option that you want for each candidate and so on,
or voting straight ticket, or what have you. And there is a tutorial mode when
you plug in your headphones, just to get you familiar with how this voting
machine works. Now, I've used other kiosks before, so for me, this isn't
particularly complicated. But perhaps if you're new to, number one, listening
to speech redo information, and number two, operating something like this kind
of kiosk, you may want to devote a little more time just to kind of get used to
how that works before you start your voting process. And thankfully you're not
timed. You can spend as much time as you need. The one thing to be aware of is
that you may very well be on your own when it comes to figuring out how these
machines work, because oftentimes the people at the polling place are not as
familiar with how to use that. They haven't necessarily had training on it. And
so you may be the one taking the time to really familiarize yourself with it,
rather than being able to come in and ask for help. But that's not to say that
there won't be help available in some cases. I'm sure that people have become
familiar with how these work after having worked at the polling place for a
while and seeing other people do it.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Jen Ottowitz:   And
Ricky, I know with the ones I've used, you can adjust things like volume and
speed. Is that the case with yours as well?</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Ricky Enger:     And
that's a good point. Yeah, because if you go in and you're familiar with this
and you really want to speed things up, you can do that, and if listening to
speech is a little difficult and it's not something you're accustomed to, then
by all means, slow that down.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Jen Ottowitz:   And it
also puts the ballot up on a screen and you can adjust some contrast settings.
It's a little bit larger print, but you can also, there's a button to turn your
display off so nobody sees what you're doing. It's usually often a kind of a
private area anyway, off to the side. Right? And usually nobody's kind of
standing behind you, waiting in line.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Ricky Enger:     But it
is nice peace of mind, right, to do that, yeah.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Steven Kelley: Do
either of you know if you could go in say, a day when it wasn't election day,
and experiment with the machine just to learn how to use it prior to?</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Jen Ottowitz:   I know
that here in Wisconsin you can contact your municipal clerk to find out which
voting machines you have at your particular polling place. And you could ask
them about any opportunities to check one out ahead of time. I know that a lot
of the independent living centers, blindness agencies, other disability
organizations may have opportunities where they have the voting machines out at
different events for you to check out ahead of time. But you might ask at your
local clerk or elections commission to see which ones is available at my
polling place. And is there a way I can practice with it ahead of time?</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Judy Matsuoka:        Have
any of you use sighted assistance to access a ballot?</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Jen Ottowitz:   I have
in the past too, and this was a long, long time ago, but I know I've worked
with clients. And Steve, I'm sure you have. Ricky, you probably know people
too, who may actually take someone with them to the polling place. It could be
a friend; it could be a family member. One thing I learned is that as long as
it's not your employer or your labor union representative. But they can go into
the poll with you and read it and I believe do the marking of the ballot for
you. And here in Wisconsin, they have to sign off, sign the ballot and actually
sign the voter registry check-in. But they don't have to be a registered voter
themselves. And if you don't have someone to go with you, you can also ask for
help from the people at the polling place, and you get one person from each
party if it's not a primary. Yeah. Have you guys had other experiences?</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Ricky Enger:     I
haven't done this in quite a long time, but I just wanted to comment on the
idea of having someone at the polling place assist you and having someone from
each party. That's really important, I think. And if you're selecting to have
sighted assistance, you may have to think about how much do I trust this person
and are they going to change my vote. And likely if you're choosing someone to
go with you to the polling place, you may already, number one, know their
political alliance, and number two, know them well enough to know that, even if
they differ in that way from you, that you can still trust them to cast your
vote appropriately.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Steven Kelley: Jennifer
and Judy, do you think ... I mean I've actually thought about this that it
might be a whole heck of a lot easier just to ask to have either a family
member act as a reader. Do you think I could walk in there without a family
member and just say, hey, I need a reader or some assistance here, and have
somebody from each party accompany me?</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Judy Matsuoka:        Here
in Arkansas, you can bring a friend or a family member. If it's somebody that
you trust, then you don't need to have the representatives of each party. It's
just if you show up at the poll and you don't have a reader with you, and you
would like assistance there, then they would have somebody from each party.
Unless like Jennifer said, it's the primary.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Jen Ottowitz:   And
they don't require proof of vision loss or anything like that. If you use the
white cane, it might be a little easier obviously, because that kind of does
the speaking for you a lot of times. But if you don't use a cane, if you just
make a request, you might explain it's because I have trouble seeing. So you
may have to go into a little bit of explanation, but they should then be able
to provide that assistance, right?</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Judy Matsuoka:        I
mean I have a friend who has a severe learning disability and reads at maybe a third-grade
level. And so she always brings somebody in, a friend or a family member to
read. And it's not always comfortable for her to say, well I have severe
dyslexia, or I don't read well enough to be able to read the ballot. And so
she'll say I brought a friend in to help read this because I've broke my
reading glasses. It makes it comfortable for her, she gets the assistance that
she needs, and they have no problem at the polls with you bringing a friend or
family member in.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Steven Kelley: I'd like
to pick up on what you just said about that, your friend who's got a little bit
of discomfort. I mean I've experienced that in the past too. And one of the
things I think I would just recommend to someone, is to try to put that aside,
move forward, because it's an important process. You don't want to avoid it and
you want to make sure that it's as accurate as possible. And I think just
letting people know that you have a vision impairment. Or maybe you don't even
need to say that, maybe just you could request sighted assistance or assistance
with the ballot. I don't know that you have to be that specific about it and
dive in.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Judy Matsuoka:        What
recommendations would any of you have for people with visual impairments who
are going to be going to the polls, particularly voting for the first time with
a visual impairment?</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Jen Ottowitz:   And I
just wanted to add in terms of getting to the polling places, I know as a
person with a vision impairment, sometimes getting anywhere can be a challenge.
But in addition to the usual ways you might get around, like paratransit, cabs,
ride sharing like Uber or Lyft, or even friends or family, sometimes
organizations, nonprofit organizations, churches may have transportation to
help take people to the polls. And so you might check with the elections
commission, or your city clerk or town clerk and look into those options too
because that may be a way to get to the polls.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Steven Kelley: I think
for somebody who may have had a recent vision loss, there's a little bit more
planning as Jennifer alluded to, if you can't just jump in your car and run
down to the poll and vote. You may want to check out to see if you can have a
ballot sent to you in advance to avoid having to go to the polling place if
you'd like to do that. And then just the transportation option. So it's not
like you can do it last minute, the election day. You may just need to do a
little bit more planning and thinking through some of these steps.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Ricky Enger:     For
me, my advice, just kind of tying all that together, is that there is no wrong
way to go about voting. The only wrong thing is to really want to vote and
choose not to do it. So there are so many different options, and you are well
within your rights to choose the thing that is most comfortable for you. If you
don't want to mess with the accessible voting machine, don't do that. Ask for
assistance at the polling place or bring a friend or family member. There are
so many different ways, thankfully, that we can accomplish this task, and it is
so important to do that. So don't get caught up in how you're doing it, just
realize that there are multiple ways that you can take care of that.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Judy Matsuoka:        These
are all wonderful recommendations to encourage people, that even if you don't
see 20/20, you should be able to vote in 2020.</span></p>

<p class=Hadley20><span style='font-family:Gotham-Book'>Ricky Enger:     So
much good information shared here. Thank you, guys, so much for joining us for
this discussion. We will have resources and links in the show notes, such as
where you can check on voter registration, some ways to look up what your
state's policies are on voting. And I love that we all had unique experiences
with voting. And we're able to share the different ways that that is possible.
And I'm extremely thankful to be able to really take a part in what happens, to
be able to let my voice be heard and cast that ballot in whatever way I see fit.
