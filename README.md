This is a collection of about 80 free documents that give guidance on how to facilitate accessible voting by Americans with disabilities.  Several state-focused guides are included, as well as general documents on voter registration, polling places, and other topics supporting accessibility in the election process.  

Although the documents are curated for current relevance, note that many were published before this year.  For specifics on dates and locations, check the latest information from state government.

To increase compatibility across devices and assistive technologies, documents in PDF and Word formats are additionally offered in HTML and plain text versions.  All files may be downloaded in a single zip archive from the following address:
