# access2vote

<http://GitHub.com/JamalMazrui/access2vote>

This is nonpartisan information for accessible voting by Americans with disabilities.  Sharing is encouraged, such as with the #access2vote hashtag.

The project is a collection of about 80 free documents that give guidance on how to facilitate accessible voting in the United States, as well as sections of this page that summarize key facts by state.  Several state-focused guides are included, as well as general documents on voter registration, polling places, and other topics supporting accessibility in the election process.  

Although the documents are curated for current relevance, note that many were published before this year.  For specifics on dates and locations, consult the latest information from state government.  Up-to-date information is also summarized in the subsequent sections below, based on the website [vote411.org](https://www.vote411.org/).

To increase compatibility across devices and assistive technologies, documents in PDF and Word formats are also offered in HTML and plain text versions.  All files in the collection may be downloaded in a single zip archive from the following address:

### Voting Machines

**Optical Scan:** With this system, you will receive a card or sheet of paper, which you take over to a private table or booth.

**Touch Screen-Paper ballots:** These units used in Alaska have a voter verifiable paper trail that allows the voter to verify the printed version of the ballot prior to casting the ballot. When voting on a touch screen, the voter has the option of having the ballot on the screen and/or listen to an audio version of the ballot and using a keypad to make the selection. Like the optical scan, when the polls close, the election board ends the election on the touch screen and then transmit results either via telephone line (for optical scan precincts) or by calling in the results to the regional office (for hand-count precincts).

**Hand Count:** These precincts are those precincts that are in rural areas of the state with fewer voters. After the polls close, the election boards tally the ballots using prepared tally books and then call in the results to the appropriate regional office. The regional offices then data enter the results into the regional GEMS computer and uploads the results to the GEMS system in the Director\'s Office via modem connection. There are 133 hand-count precincts in Alaska.

### Polling Place Locator

You can confirm your voting location by selecting from the following local resources: [Arizona State Poll Locator Tool.](https://voter.azsos.gov/)

 

### Voting Machines

The voting systems used in Arizona are Optical Scan and DRE.

**Optical Scan:** With this system, you will receive a card or sheet of paper, which you take over to a private table or booth. The card has the names of the candidates and ballot measures printed on it. With a pen or pencil you fill in a little box or circle or the space between two arrows. When you are finished filling out all the cards, you bring the cards over to a ballot box, where poll workers will show you how to put the cards in the box. Or in some places, you may feed the completed cards or papers into a computer device that checks your card or paper right there at the polling place to make sure you have voted the way you want to and counts the votes.

**Direct Recording Electronic (DRE):** All the information about who and what you are voting for is on an electronic screen like a TV or computer screen.

There are many variations of DREs because lots of companies are inventing new ones, and many cities, counties and states are trying them out. Usually, after you have signed in, the poll workers will give you a card that you slide into a device to start your voting session.

Some of these devices will show all of the candidates and ballot choices on one big screen. Often, with these big screen devices you push a button next to the name of the candidate you want to vote for (or yes or no on a ballot measure). On other DREs, the screen is set up to show pages. On each screen or page, there will probably be one thing to vote on. For example, on one screen or page, you might vote for president. Then you might move to the next page to vote for senator. Often these small-screen devices have a touch screen where you touch the screen next to the name of the person you want to vote for. Other devices have a key pad. And some have a keyboard, so you can write in the name of someone you want to vote for.

You let the system know you are finished voting by pushing a button, touching the screen or entering something on a keypad.

### Voting Machines

The voting systems used in Arkansas are optical scan and DRE.

**Optical Scan:** With this system, you will receive a card or sheet of paper, which you take over to a private table or booth. The card has the names of the various candidates and ballot measures printed on it. With a pen or pencil you fill in a little box or circle or the space between two arrows. When you are finished filling out all the cards, you may bring the cards over to a ballot box, where poll workers will show you how to put the cards in the box. Or in some places, you may feed the completed cards or papers into a computer device that checks your card or paper right there at the polling place to make sure you have voted the way you want to and counts the votes.

**Direct Recording Electronic (DRE):** This is the newest kind of system in use in the U.S. All the information about who and what you are voting for is on an electronic screen like a TV or computer screen.

There are many variations of DREs because lots of companies are inventing new ones, and many cities, counties and states are trying them out. Usually, after you have signed in, the poll workers will give you a card that you slide into a device to start your voting session.

Some of these devices will show all of the candidates and ballot choices on one big screen. Often, with these big screen devices you push a button next to the name of the candidate you want to vote for (or yes or no on a ballot measure). On other DREs, the screen is set up to show pages. On each screen or page, there will probably be one thing to vote on. For example, on one screen or page, you might vote for president. Then you might move to the next page to vote for senator. Often these small-screen devices have a touch screen, where you touch the screen next to the name of the person you want to vote for. Other devices have a key pad. And some have a keyboard, so you can write in the name of someone you want to vote for.

You let the system know you are finished voting by pushing a button, touching the screen or entering something on a keypad.

**iVotronic Touch Screen:** With system the voter uses a touch screen to place their votes. This system prevents voters from casting two votes in a single race and alerts the voter of races with no votes cast. It includes a paper receipt that remains in the machine but allows voters to see their individual votes to verify the machine records them correctly.

You can learn more about voting systems by checking out the [Elections Assistance Commission\'s (EAC) resource.](http://www.eac.gov/testing_and_certification/voluntary_voting_system_guidelines.aspx)

### Overseas and Military Voters

You are a Military or Overseas voter if you are in uniformed services, living overseas OR a spouse or dependent of a uniformed services voter. To get registered and vote, you can utilize [Overseas Vote Foundation.](https://www.overseasvotefoundation.org/about-contact)

If you have additional questions about elections and voting overseas you can use our state specific elections official directory or contact the [Overseas Vote Foundation.](https://www.overseasvotefoundation.org/about-contact)

### Provisional Voting

If your name is not on the precinct voter registration list, or you do not show a valid photo ID, the election official will let you vote only if you meet specific conditions.

Those conditions are:

-   You identify yourself by stating your name, date of birth and that you are verified by the county clerk as a registered voter within the county
-   You affirm your current residence and the election official verifies with the county clerk that your residence is within the precinct
-   You complete an updated voter registration application form
-   You sign the precinct voter registration list

If you are not listed on the precinct voter registration list and the election official is unable to verify your registration with the county clerk and you contend that you are eligible to vote, then you may vote a challenged ballot which shall only be counted upon verification of your registration status by the county board of election commissioners prior to certification of the election.

Provisional ballots are counted between 2-15 days after the election.

### Ranked Choice Voting

### Time Off to Vote

### Vote by Mail

## California

### Absentee Ballot Process

**All registered voters receive a mail ballot before each Election Day. The voted ballot must be postmarked by the Election Day and received 17 days after the election in order to be counted.**

Any registered voter may Vote By Mail. You use one of the following methods to vote by mail:

-   Applying in writing to your [county election official](https://www.overseasvotefoundation.org/vote/election-official-directory)
-   Completing the absentee ballot application that is included in your sample ballot, which your county elections official will mail to you prior to each election
-   Downloading and completing an [vote-by-mail application](http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/mov/how-special-absentee.htm) on-line.
-   Contact your [county election official](https://www.overseasvotefoundation.org/vote/election-official-directory) to see if your county allows you to apply by telephone.

Elections officials process applications 29 days to 7 days before an election. You may request an absentee ballot more than 29 days before an election, but not fewer than 7 days in advance.

Permanent Absentee Voting (PAV)

Any registered voter may apply for permanent absentee voter status. If you are a permanent absentee voter, you will automatically receive an absentee ballot for each election. To become a permanent absentee voter, you must complete an application, which is available from your [county election official](https://vote411.overseasvotefoundation.org/vote/eod.htm).

If you complete an application to become a permanent absentee voter, you will retain this status as long as you vote in all statewide primary and general elections. If you fail to cast a ballot in four consecutive statewide general elections, you will be removed from the permanent absent voter list and will need to reapply in order to restore status.

Late Absentee Ballot Requests

If, in the seven days before the election, you find you will not be able to vote in person on Election Day, you may still request an absentee ballot. You must make a written request, signed under penalty of perjury, and deliver it, either in person or by someone you designate, to your [county election official](https://www.overseasvotefoundation.org/vote/election-official-directory).

According to California Elections laws, individuals, organizations and groups may distribute absentee ballot applications; however, they must use the uniform format as specified in the California Elections Code. A copy of the application form is available on your [state\'s website.](http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/vote-by-mail/pdf/vote-by-mail-application.pdf)

### Provisions for Voters with Disabilities

It is recommended that you contact your [](https://vote411.overseasvotefoundation.org/overseas/eod.htm) [county elections official](https://www.overseasvotefoundation.org/vote/election-official-directory) regarding whether or not curbside voting is available at your polling place. If curbside voting is available at your polling place, you may approach as near as possible to the voting area and elections officials may bring you a roster to sign, a ballot to vote, and any other voting materials you may need, whether you are actually at a curb, in a car, or otherwise located outside the polls.

Both state and federal laws require that all voters, including voters with disabilities, be able to cast their ballots privately and independently. New voting systems have been specifically designed for this purpose. Each polling place should have at least one voting system that permits voters, including those who are blind or visually impaired, to cast a ballot without assistance. In addition, the voting system must permit you to privately and independently verify your vote choices and, if there is an error, permit you to correct those choices before the ballot is cast. To find out what system your county uses, and how to use it, please visit your [local board of elections.](https://www.overseasvotefoundation.org/vote/election-official-directory)

Although new accessible voting equipment is required to enable voters with disabilities to cast a ballot privately and independently, if you want help, or if for any reason you are unable to personally mark your ballot, you may choose up to two people to help you cast your vote. However, the persons or person you choose may not be your employer or your employer\'s agent, or your labor union leader or agent.

If, for any reason, your name does not appear on the list of voters at a polling place, you have the right to cast a provisional ballot. This is a ballot just like a regular ballot, but it will be placed in a special envelope and will be counted after the elections official confirms that you are eligible to vote. The official at the polling place will give you information about how to find out if your ballot was counted, and, if it was not counted, the reason why.

For more information, you can utilize the [American Association of People With Disabilities (AAPD)](http://www.aapd.com/what-we-do/voting/) resource.

### Early Voting

You can vote early either in person at your county elections office, or by using the vote-by-mail system. Any registered voter may vote early instead of going to the polls on Election Day.

All valid vote-by-mail ballots are counted in every election in California, regardless of the outcome or closeness of any race.

Once your application is processed by your county elections official, your ballot will be sent to you. After you have voted, insert your ballot in the envelope provided, making sure you complete all required information on the envelope. You may return your voted vote-by-mail ballot by 1) mailing it to your county elections official; 2) returning it in person to a polling place or the elections office in your county on Election Day; or 3) authorizing anyone to return the ballot on your behalf.

If you have additional questions about elections and voting overseas you can use our state specific elections official directory or contact the [Overseas Vote Foundation.](https://www.overseasvotefoundation.org/about-contact)

### Provisional Voting

You may be asked to vote a provisional ballot at the polls due to specific reasons.

Those reasons are:

-   Your name is not on the official roster of voters and the election officer cannot verify your voting eligibility on Election Day. The elections official\'s office will then check the registration records. If further research determines that you are eligible to vote in the election, the provisional ballot will be counted.
-   You have moved within the county, but did not re-register to vote. The elections official will verify your prior registration before the provisional ballot will be counted. Your registration will then be updated with your current address.
-   Records indicate that you requested an absentee ballot and you fail to turn in the absentee ballot at the polls on Election Day. The [election official\'s office](https://www.overseasvotefoundation.org/vote/election-official-directory) will check the records, and if you did not vote an absentee ballot, your provisional ballot will be counted.
-   You are a first-time federal election voter in the county and were unable to provide the required proof of identification. The elections official\'s office will verify your eligibility to vote by comparing the signature on your registration with the signature on the provisional ballot envelope.

Provisional ballots are counted during the official canvass when:

-   Prior to the completion of the official canvass (the vote tally), the elections official\'s office establishes, from voter registration records, your right to vote the ballot.
-   Or by order of the Superior Court in the county of your residence, you seek a court order to require that your ballot be counted, at any time prior to the completion of the official canvass. Any judicial action or appeal shall have priority over all other civil matters.

Provisional ballots are counted no later than the Thursday after the election until completed.

The Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) requires each state or local elections official to establish a \"Free Access System,\" such as a toll-free telephone number for voters to call or an internet website that you can access free of charge, to ascertain whether or not your provisional vote was counted, and, if it was not counted, the reason why it was not counted. For information about how to access each county\'s Provisional Voting Free Access System, please visit your [state\'s resource.](http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ballot-status/)

### Voting Machines

The voting machine systems used in Colorado are optical scan, DRE and hand-counted paper ballots.

**Optical Scan:** With this system, you will receive a card or sheet of paper, which you take over to a private table or booth. The card has the names of the various candidates and ballot measures printed on it. With a pen or pencil you fill in a little box or circle or the space between two arrows. When you are finished filling out all the cards, you may bring the cards over to a ballot box, where poll workers will show you how to put the cards in the box. Or in some places, you may feed the completed cards or papers into a computer device that checks your card or paper right there at the polling place to make sure you have voted the way you want to and counts the votes.

**Direct Recording Electronic (DRE):** This is the newest kind of system in use in the U.S. All the information about who and what you are voting for is on an electronic screen like a TV or computer screen.

There are many variations of DREs because lots of companies are inventing new ones, and many cities, counties and states are trying them out. Usually, after you have signed in, the poll workers will give you a card that you slide into a device to start your voting session.

Some of these devices will show all of the candidates and ballot choices on one big screen. Often, with these big screen devices you push a button next to the name of the candidate you want to vote for (or yes or no on a ballot measure). On other DREs, the screen is set up to show pages. On each screen or page, there will probably be one thing to vote on. For example, on one screen or page, you might vote for president. Then you might move to the next page to vote for senator. Often these small-screen devices have a touch screen, where you touch the screen next to the name of the person you want to vote for. Other devices have a key pad. Some have a keyboard, so you can write in the name of someone you want to vote for.

You let the system know you are finished voting by pushing a button, touching the screen or entering something on a keypad.

**Paper Ballots:** Paper ballots are one of the oldest ways of voting in America. They are still used in a few places on Election Day. When you come to the polling place, you will get a paper ballot from the poll worker. You take it to the voting booth, and use a pen or pencil to mark a box next to your candidate and issue choices. You then drop the marked ballot into a sealed ballot box.

You can learn more about voting systems by checking out [the Elections Assistance Commission\'s (EAC) resource](http://www.eac.gov/testing_and_certification/voluntary_voting_system_guidelines.aspx) or through [Verified Voting](https://www.verifiedvoting.org/verifier/#year/2016/).

### Provisional Voting

You may vote provisionally if you meet a specific condition.

Those conditions are:

-   You vote outside the county where you live (if you chose this option your provisional ballot will not count if it is determined you voted in the wrong county instead of the correct county.)
-   The statewide registration system shows you already voted in the election
-   You don\'t present a valid form of ID

**You can register and change your address on Election Day to vote a normal ballot.**

After you vote a provisional ballot, you will receive a receipt. This receipt will explain how you determine the status of your provisional ballot.

Provisional ballots will be counted after the voters\' eligibility is confirmed and no later than 9 days after a primary, general, odd-year, or coordinated election.

A provisional ballot affidavit is treated as a voter registration application for the next election, regardless of whether the provisional ballot is counted, as long as the affidavit contains all the required information and the voter is eligible to register.

### Voting Machines

The voting system used in Delaware is DRE.

**Direct Recording Electronic (DRE):** This is the newest kind of system in use in the U.S. All the information about who and what you are voting for is on an electronic screen like a TV or computer screen.

There are many variations of DREs because lots of companies are inventing new ones, and many cities, counties and states are trying them out. Usually, after you have signed in, the poll workers will give you a card that you slide into a device to start your voting session.

Some of these devices will show all of the candidates and ballot choices on one big screen. Often, with these big screen devices you push a button next to the name of the candidate you want to vote for (or yes or no on a ballot measure). On other DREs, the screen is set up to show pages. On each screen or page, there will probably be one thing to vote on. For example, on one screen or page, you might vote for president. Then you might move to the next page to vote for senator. Often these small-screen devices have a touch screen, where you touch the screen next to the name of the person you want to vote for. Other devices have a key pad. Some have a keyboard, so you can write in the name of someone you want to vote for.

You let the system know you are finished voting by pushing a button, touching the screen or entering something on a keypad.

### Voting Machines

The voting system used in Georgia is DRE.

**Direct Recording Electronic (DRE):** This is the newest kind of system in use in the U.S. All the information about who and what you are voting for is on an electronic screen like a TV or computer screen.

There are many variations of DREs because lots of companies are inventing new ones, and many cities, counties and states are trying them out. Usually, after you have signed in, the poll workers will give you a card that you slide into a device to start your voting session.

Some of these devices will show all of the candidates and ballot choices on one big screen. Often, with these big screen devices you push a button next to the name of the candidate you want to vote for (or yes or no on a ballot measure). On other DREs, the screen is set up to show pages. On each screen or page, there will probably be one thing to vote on. For example, on one screen or page, you might vote for president. Then you might move to the next page to vote for senator. Often these small-screen devices have a touch screen, where you touch the screen next to the name of the person you want to vote for. Other devices have a key pad. Some have a keyboard, so you can write in the name of someone you want to vote for.

You let the system know you are finished voting by pushing a button, touching the screen or entering something on a keypad.

You can learn more about voting systems by checking out the [Elections Assistance Commission\'s (EAC) resource.](http://www.eac.gov/testing_and_certification/voluntary_voting_system_guidelines.aspx)

### Provisional Voting

Provisional voting allows you to cast a ballot in person even if the requirements for doing so cannot be met at the time. The provisional ballot will count if the problem is solved within three days after Election Day.

The three reasons for voting a provisional ballot are:

-   When you first registered to vote in Georgia you registered by mail, did not provide any identification at the time and are unable to present acceptable identification the first time you vote in person
-   Your name does not appear on the list of registered voters in the precinct

If you vote a provisional ballot because you did not have acceptable identification, you will have three days from the close of the polls to present acceptable identification to your county registrar office for your vote to count.

### Ranked Choice Voting

### Time Off to Vote

### Provisions for Voters with Disabilities

If you are a long stay patient at a care home or a patient unexpectedly admitted to a hospital, you are still eligible to vote. To ensure the security and integrity of election related activities at care facilities, staff members are discouraged from participating directly with a voter in the process of registering and/or voting absentee. Staff may assist only upon receiving specific authorization from the resident (voter). When asked by a voter to give assistance, care facility staff must remain nonpartisan and have at least two people NOT of the same political party present. This will help eliminate the appearance of any election irregularities while assisting a voter. In addition, staff should:

-   Always be mindful of the voting rights of patients as well as their family members
-   Refrain from explicit or implicit discriminatory or coercive voter registration practices, as both are prohibited
-   Not collect completed voter registration forms shall unless specific authorization is provided by the clerk or chief election officer
-   Mail requests for an absentee ballot directly to the local clerk
-   Not copy, duplicate or otherwise make use of any information provided on registration forms. Information provided by the voter on the affidavit for registration is confidential
-   If acting as an intermediary to pick up an absentee ballot, obtain a letter of authorization from the registered voter and submit it to the clerk
-   Ensure that no one asks a voter to see or look at the contents of a voted ballot or choice of party
-   Ensure that no one marks a voter\'s ballot or directs a voter without authorization
-   Not attempt to vote in the name of the patient without specific authorization, as it is illegal

If you require assistance to vote by reason of physical, visual, hearing impairment or inability to read or write, you may be given assistance by a person of the your choice, except for your employer, an agent of your employer, or officer or agent of your union.

You may also request to register to vote by mail.If you are permanently physically disabled, in a nursing home or in a hospital, you may also be eligible for absentee voting.

The Help America Vote Act requires that election authorities have voting equipment in place for voters with disabilities to vote privately and independently, and Illinois is no exception. Additionally, there are options for a seated voting booth, voting assistance from a friend, relative, or two election judges (one from each party), and curbside voting.

### Polling Place Locator

You can find your polling place by utilizing your [state](https://ova.elections.il.gov/PollingPlaceLookup.aspx) [resource.](https://ova.elections.il.gov/PollingPlaceLookup.aspx)

If you have further questions on your polling place location, please contact your [county clerk](https://www.overseasvotefoundation.org/vote/election-official-directory).

### Voting Machines

The voting systems used in Illinois are optical scan and DRE.

To find out what voting machine is used in your county, please visit your [state\'s resource.](https://www.elections.il.gov/ElectionOperations/ElectionDayVoting.aspx?MID=Szw0eRrv1dQ%3d&T=637177054543785453)

**Optical Scan:** With this system, you will receive a card or sheet of paper, which you take over to a private table or booth. The card has the names of the various candidates and ballot measures printed on it. With a pen or pencil you fill in a little box or circle or the space between two arrows. When you are finished filling out all the cards, you may bring the cards over to a ballot box, where poll workers will show you how to put the cards in the box. Or in some places, you may feed the completed cards or papers into a computer device that checks your card or paper right there at the polling place to make sure you have voted the way you want to and counts the votes.

**Direct Recording Electronic (DRE):** This is the newest kind of system in use in the U.S. All the information about who and what you are voting for is on an electronic screen like a TV or computer screen.

There are many variations of DREs because lots of companies are inventing new ones, and many cities, counties and states are trying them out. Usually, after you have signed in, the poll workers will give you a card that you slide into a device to start your voting session.

Some of these devices will show all of the candidates and ballot choices on one big screen. Often, with these big screen devices you push a button next to the name of the candidate you want to vote for (or yes or no on a ballot measure). On other DREs, the screen is set up to show pages. On each screen or page, there will probably be one thing to vote on. For example, on one screen or page, you might vote for president. Then you might move to the next page to vote for senator. Often these small-screen devices have a touch screen, where you touch the screen next to the name of the person you want to vote for. Other devices have a key pad. Some have a keyboard, so you can write in the name of someone you want to vote for.

You let the system know you are finished voting by pushing a button, touching the screen or entering something on a keypad.

You can learn more about voting systems by checking out the [Elections Assistance Commission\'s (EAC) resource](http://www.eac.gov/testing_and_certification/voluntary_voting_system_guidelines.aspx) or through [Verified Voting](https://www.verifiedvoting.org/verifier/#year/2016/).

Applications for absentee ballots can be obtained [online](http://sos.iowa.gov/elections/pdf/absenteeballotapp.pdf) in a PDF format, or mailed upon request from the Secretary of State. You can also request a ballot by mailing the application to the [county auditor/commissioner of elections](https://www.overseasvotefoundation.org/vote/election-official-directory) in the county where you are registered.

You must provide ID information on your absentee ballot request forms. All request forms must include your driver\'s license/non-driver\'s ID number or your Voter ID Card\'s four-digit PIN number. Request forms without these forms of ID will not be accepted.

**The request form must be received in the county auditor\'s office by 5 pm on the Friday, 11 days before the election OR, for General Elections, the deadline is the Saturday, 10 days before the election.** If the request is received so late that it is unlikely the absentee ballot can be returned by mail in time to be considered for counting, the county auditor will enclose a statement to that effect with the absentee ballot.

-   Surrender your voted absentee ballot at the polls and vote a regular ballot
-   Vote a provisional ballot at the polls if you cannot surrender your voted absentee ballot

### Provisions for Voters with Disabilities

If you need help marking your ballot because of a disability or because you can\'t read English, any person you choose may help you, except your employer, your employer\'s agent or an officer or agent of your union. If you want help from the precinct workers, one person from each political party will help you. You will need to sign a form indicating that you asked for help. All voting instructions at the polls are printed in large type.

If you cannot get into the polling place because of a disability, two precinct workers will bring a ballot to your vehicle. They may also help you mark the ballot, but only if you request assistance. You do not have to tell anyone ahead of time that you will need to vote in your car. However, you may want to call ahead or bring someone with you to tell the precinct workers that you need to vote in your car.

Each polling place has a Voter Assist Terminal. Voters here can use features such as touch screens, audio assistance or a sip and puff element to select their candidates.

If you have questions or concerns about voting accessibility, please contact your [county auditor\'s office](http://www.sos.state.ia.us/publications/countydirectory/index.html) or your [Secretary of State\'s office](http://www.sos.state.ia.us/).

### Voting Machines

The voting systems used in Kansas are optical scan, DRE and paper ballots. To find out what system(s) your county uses, click [here.](http://www.kssos.org/forms/elections/voting%20systems.pdf)

**Optical Scan:** With this system, you will receive a card or sheet of paper, which you take over to a private table or booth. The card has the names of the various candidates and ballot measures printed on it. With a pen or pencil you fill in a little box or circle or the space between two arrows. When you are finished filling out all the cards, you may bring the cards over to a ballot box, where poll workers will show you how to put the cards in the box. Or in some places, you may feed the completed cards or papers into a computer device that checks your card or paper right there at the polling place to make sure you have voted the way you want to and counts the votes.

**Direct Recording Electronic (DRE):** This is the newest kind of system in use in the U.S. All the information about who and what you are voting for is on an electronic screen like a TV or computer screen.

There are many variations of DREs because lots of companies are inventing new ones, and many cities, counties and states are trying them out. Usually, after you have signed in, the poll workers will give you a card that you slide into a device to start your voting session.

Some of these devices will show all of the candidates and ballot choices on one big screen. Often, with these big screen devices you push a button next to the name of the candidate you want to vote for (or yes or no on a ballot measure). On other DREs, the screen is set up to show pages. On each screen or page, there will probably be one thing to vote on. For example, on one screen or page, you might vote for president. Then you might move to the next page to vote for senator. Often these small-screen devices have a touch screen, where you touch the screen next to the name of the person you want to vote for. Other devices have a key pad. Some have a keyboard, so you can write in the name of someone you want to vote for.

You let the system know you are finished voting by pushing a button, touching the screen or entering something on a keypad.

**Paper Ballots:** Paper ballots are one of the oldest ways of voting in America. They are still used in a few places on Election Day. When you come to the polling place, you will get a paper ballot from the poll worker. You take it to the voting booth, and use a pen or pencil to mark a box next to your candidate and issue choices. You then drop the marked ballot into a sealed ballot box.

### Voting Machines

The voting system used in Louisiana is DRE.

**Direct Recording Electronic (DRE):** This is the newest kind of system in use in the U.S. All the information about who and what you are voting for is on an electronic screen like a TV or computer screen.

There are many variations of DREs because lots of companies are inventing new ones, and many cities, counties and states are trying them out. Usually, after you have signed in, the poll workers will give you a card that you slide into a device to start your voting session.

Some of these devices will show all of the candidates and ballot choices on one big screen. Often, with these big screen devices you push a button next to the name of the candidate you want to vote for (or yes or no on a ballot measure). On other DREs, the screen is set up to show pages. On each screen or page, there will probably be one thing to vote on. For example, on one screen or page, you might vote for president. Then you might move to the next page to vote for senator. Often these small-screen devices have a touch screen, where you touch the screen next to the name of the person you want to vote for. Other devices have a key pad. And some have a keyboard, so you can write in the name of someone you want to vote for.

You let the system know you are finished voting by pushing a button, touching the screen or entering something on a keypad.

**Optical Scan:** With this system, you will receive a card or sheet of paper, which you take over to a private table or booth. The card has the names of the various candidates and ballot measures printed on it. With a pen or pencil you fill in a little box or circle or the space between two arrows. When you are finished filling out all the cards, you may bring the cards over to a ballot box, where poll workers will show you how to put the cards in the box. Or in some places, you may feed the completed cards or papers into a computer device that checks your card or paper right there at the polling place to make sure you have voted the way you want to and counts the votes.

**Paper Ballots:** Paper ballots are one of the oldest ways of voting in America. They are still used in a few places on Election Day. When you come to the polling place, you will get a paper ballot from the poll worker. You take it to the voting booth, and use a pen or pencil to mark a box next to your candidate and issue choices. You then drop the marked ballot into a sealed ballot box.

### Voting Machines

The voting systems used in Minnesota are optical scan, paper ballots and DRE.

**Optical Scan:** With this system, you will receive a card or sheet of paper, which you take over to a private table or booth. The card has the names of the various candidates and ballot measures printed on it. With a pen or pencil you fill in a little box or circle or the space between two arrows. When you are finished filling out all the cards, you may bring the cards over to a ballot box, where poll workers will show you how to put the cards in the box. Or in some places, you may feed the completed cards or papers into a computer device that checks your card or paper right there at the polling place to make sure you have voted the way you want to and counts the votes.

**Paper Ballots:** Paper ballots are one of the oldest ways of voting in America. They are still used in a few places on Election Day. When you come to the polling place, you will get a paper ballot from the poll worker. You take it to the voting booth, and use a pen or pencil to mark a box next to your candidate and issue choices. You then drop the marked ballot into a sealed ballot box.

**Direct Recording Electronic (DRE):** This is the newest kind of system in use in the U.S. All the information about who and what you are voting for is on an electronic screen like a TV or computer screen.

There are many variations of DREs because lots of companies are inventing new ones, and many cities, counties and states are trying them out. Usually, after you have signed in, the poll workers will give you a card that you slide into a device to start your voting session.

Some of these devices will show all of the candidates and ballot choices on one big screen. Often, with these big screen devices you push a button next to the name of the candidate you want to vote for (or yes or no on a ballot measure). On other DREs, the screen is set up to show pages. On each screen or page, there will probably be one thing to vote on. For example, on one screen or page, you might vote for president. Then you might move to the next page to vote for senator.

### Voting Machines

The voting systems used in Mississippi are DRE and paper ballots.

**Direct Recording Electronic (DRE):** This is the newest kind of system in use in the U.S. All the information about who and what you are voting for is on an electronic screen like a TV or computer screen.

There are many variations of DREs because lots of companies are inventing new ones, and many cities, counties and states are trying them out. Usually, after you have signed in, the poll workers will give you a card that you slide into a device to start your voting session.

Some of these devices will show all of the candidates and ballot choices on one big screen. Often, with these big screen devices you push a button next to the name of the candidate you want to vote for (or yes or no on a ballot measure). On other DREs, the screen is set up to show pages. On each screen or page, there will probably be one thing to vote on. For example, on one screen or page, you might vote for president. Then you might move to the next page to vote for senator. Often these small-screen devices have a touch screen, where you touch the screen next to the name of the person you want to vote for. Other devices have a key pad. And some have a keyboard, so you can write in the name of someone you want to vote for.

You let the system know you are finished voting by pushing a button, touching the screen or entering something on a keypad.

**Paper Ballots:** Paper ballots are one of the oldest ways of voting in America. They are still used in a few places on Election Day. When you come to the polling place, you will get a paper ballot from the poll worker. You take it to the voting booth, and use a pen or pencil to mark a box next to your candidate and issue choices. You then drop the marked ballot into a sealed ballot box.

You can learn more about voting systems by checking out the [Elections Assistance Commission\'s (EAC) resource.](http://www.eac.gov/testing_and_certification/voluntary_voting_system_guidelines.aspx)

### Voting Machines

The voting systems used in Missouri are optical scan and punch card.

**Optical Scan:** With this system, you will receive a card or sheet of paper, which you take over to a private table or booth. The card has the names of the various candidates and ballot measures printed on it. With a pen or pencil you fill in a little box or circle or the space between two arrows. When you are finished filling out all the cards, you may bring the cards over to a ballot box, where poll workers will show you how to put the cards in the box. Or in some places, you may feed the completed cards or papers into a computer device that checks your card or paper right there at the polling place to make sure you have voted the way you want to and counts the votes.

**Punchcards:** With a punchcard system, when you sign in at the polling place, the poll workers will give you one or more cards. These cards are usually about 8 inches by 3 inches, with small rectangles that can be punched out. You take your cards to a small private table. You\'ll see a booklet mounted on a frame. The frame will have a place for you to slide your first card in. Make sure that it\'s in all the way and lined up correctly. If you\'re not sure, ask one of the poll workers to make sure you\'ve got it right. The table also has a little device (often a metal stylus or stick) that you use to punch holes next to the name of the person or ballot measure you want to vote for. Give it a firm punch, so it pushes out that little cardboard rectangle or chad. You may have to look at the booklet carefully so that you punch the right hole lined up with the person you want to vote for. Often there is a little arrow that helps you find the right hole. Some punchcards have the names of the candidates written right on the cards. You may need to vote on more than one card. Look it over carefully, so you put the right card in the right slot. Some punch card systems use both sides of the card, so look on the back of each card too. Check to see that all the holes are punched all the way through and there are no little pieces of cardboard (chad) hanging from your card. When you are done, pick up all your cards. There may be an envelope to put your cards in. Take your cards over to the ballot box and put the cards into the box.

### Voting Machines

The voting systems used in Nebraska are optical scan and DRE.

**Optical Scan:** With this system, you will receive a card or sheet of paper, which you take over to a private table or booth. The card has the names of the various candidates and ballot measures printed on it. With a pen or pencil you fill in a little box or circle or the space between two arrows. When you are finished filling out all the cards, you may bring the cards over to a ballot box, where poll workers will show you how to put the cards in the box. Or in some places, you may feed the completed cards or papers into a computer device that checks your card or paper right there at the polling place to make sure you have voted the way you want to and counts the votes.

**Direct Recording Electronic (DRE):** This is the newest kind of system in use in the U.S. All the information about who and what you are voting for is on an electronic screen like a TV or computer screen.

There are many variations of DREs because lots of companies are inventing new ones, and many cities, counties and states are trying them out. Usually, after you have signed in, the poll workers will give you a card that you slide into a device to start your voting session.

Some of these devices will show all of the candidates and ballot choices on one big screen. Often, with these big screen devices you push a button next to the name of the candidate you want to vote for (or yes or no on a ballot measure). On other DREs, the screen is set up to show pages. On each screen or page, there will probably be one thing to vote on. For example, on one screen or page, you might vote for president. Then you might move to the next page to vote for senator. Often these small-screen devices have a touch screen, where you touch the screen next to the name of the person you want to vote for. Other devices have a key pad. And some have a keyboard, so you can write in the name of someone you want to vote for.

You let the system know you are finished voting by pushing a button, touching the screen or entering something on a keypad.

### Voting Machines

The voting system used in New Jersery is DRE.

**Direct Recording Electronic (DRE):** This is the newest kind of system in use in the U.S. All the information about who and what you are voting for is on an electronic screen like a TV or computer screen.

There are many variations of DREs because lots of companies are inventing new ones, and many cities, counties and states are trying them out. Usually, after you have signed in, the poll workers will give you a card that you slide into a device to start your voting session.

Some of these devices will show all of the candidates and ballot choices on one big screen. Often, with these big screen devices you push a button next to the name of the candidate you want to vote for (or yes or no on a ballot measure). On other DREs, the screen is set up to show pages. On each screen or page, there will probably be one thing to vote on. For example, on one screen or page, you might vote for president. Then you might move to the next page to vote for senator. Often these small-screen devices have a touch screen, where you touch the screen next to the name of the person you want to vote for. Other devices have a key pad. And some have a keyboard, so you can write in the name of someone you want to vote for.

You let the system know you are finished voting by pushing a button, touching the screen or entering something on a keypad.

### Voting Machines

The voting systems used in North Carolina are optical scan, DRE, and hand-counted paper ballots.

**Optical Scanning**: With this system, you will recieve a card or sheet of paper, which you take over to a private table or booth. The card has the names of the various candidates and ballot measures printed on it. With a pen or pencil you fill in a little box or circle or the space between two arrows. In some places, you can check your card or paper right there at the polling place by feeding it into a card-reading machine to make sure you have voted the way you want to. When you are finished filling out all the cards. You may bring the cards over to a ballot box, where poll workers will show you how to put the cards in the box. Or in some places, you may feed the completed cards or papers into a computer device that counts the votes. When Election Day is over, the computer counts how many votes were cast for each candidate.

**Direct Recording Electronic (DRE)** : This is the newest kind of system in use in the US. All the information about who and what you are voting for is on an electronic screen, like a TV or computer screen. The poll workers will give you a card that you slide into a device to start your voting session. These devices will show all of the candidates and ballot choices on one big screen. Often, with these bigscreen devices you push a button next to the name of the candidate you want to votefor (or yes or no on a ballot measure). On each screen or page, there will probably be one thing to vote on. For example, on one screen or page, you might vote for president. Then you might move to the next page to vote for senator. Often these small-screen devices have a touch screen, where you touch the screen next to the name of the person you want to vote for. Some of these machinese have a key pad, and/ or have a keyboard, so you can write in the name of someone you want to vote for. You let the system know you are finished voting by pushing a button, touching the screen or entering something on a keypad. The votes are stored on a computer device like a disk or a cartridge. At the end of the day, results from the disk or cartridge can be printed and read at the polling place or transferred to a central location.

**Paper Ballots**: Paper ballots are one of the oldest ways of voting in America. They are still used on Election Day. Paper ballots are mostly used for absentee ballots. When you come to the polling place, you will get a paper ballot from the poll worker. You take it to the voting booth, and use a pen or pencil to mark a box next to your candidate and issue choices. You then drop the marked ballot into a sealed ballot box. At the end of the day, votes are counted by poll workers reading the ballots.

### Voting Machines

The voting systems used in Ohio are optical scan and DRE.

**Optical Scan:** With this system, you will receive a card or sheet of paper, which you take over to a private table or booth. The card has the names of the various candidates and ballot measures printed on it. With a pen or pencil you fill in a little box or circle or the space between two arrows. When you are finished filling out all the cards, you may bring the cards over to a ballot box, where poll workers will show you how to put the cards in the box. Or in some places, you may feed the completed cards or papers into a computer device that checks your card or paper right there at the polling place to make sure you have voted the way you want to and counts the votes.

**Direct Recording Electronic (DRE):** This is the newest kind of system in use in the U.S. All the information about who and what you are voting for is on an electronic screen like a TV or computer screen.

There are many variations of DREs because lots of companies are inventing new ones, and many cities, counties and states are trying them out. Usually, after you have signed in, the poll workers will give you a card that you slide into a device to start your voting session.

Some of these devices will show all of the candidates and ballot choices on one big screen. Often, with these big screen devices you push a button next to the name of the candidate you want to vote for (or yes or no on a ballot measure). On other DREs, the screen is set up to show pages. On each screen or page, there will probably be one thing to vote on. For example, on one screen or page, you might vote for president. Then you might move to the next page to vote for senator. Often these small-screen devices have a touch screen, where you touch the screen next to the name of the person you want to vote for. Other devices have a key pad. And some have a keyboard, so you can write in the name of someone you want to vote for.

You let the system know you are finished voting by pushing a button, touching the screen or entering something on a keypad.

You can learn more about voting systems by checking out the [Elections Assistance Commission\'s (EAC) resource.](http://www.eac.gov/testing_and_certification/voluntary_voting_system_guidelines.aspx)

### Provisional Voting

A provisional ballot is used to record a vote if the voter\'s eligibility is in question and the voter would otherwise not be allowed to vote.

There are several scenarios where a voter may cast a provisional ballot:

-   Your name does not appear on the official poll list for the precinct or an election official asserts that you are not eligible to vote or is unable to determine your eligibility
-   You are unable or decline to provide the required proof of identity
-   Your name appears on the official poll list for that precinct as having already requested an absentee ballot
-   Your name is marked on the poll list or signature book with a notation that certain registration mailings have been returned as un-deliverable
-   A hearing on a challenge to your eligibility as an elector has been postponed until after Election Day
-   Your signature, in the opinion of the precinct officers, does not match the signature on your registration form
-   Your eligibility to cast a ballot has been challenged by the precinct officials

Before your provisional ballot can be included in the official count of an election, the board of elections must confirm your eligibility to cast the ballot, as well as the validity of the ballot that you cast. If you cast a provisional ballot and provided acceptable proof of identity, you typically do not need to provide any additional information. However, if you cast a provisional ballot and did not provide acceptable proof of identity at the time of voting, you must appear in person at the board of elections no later than seven days following the election to provide such proof within the 10 days immediately following Election Day. Acceptable proof of identity includes:

-   Current and valid photo ID
-   A military identification
-   A copy of a current (within the last 12 months) utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or other government document (not a voter registration acknowledgement mailed by the board of elections) that shows your name and current address
-   The last four digits of your Social Security number

Provisional ballots are counted until the 11th day after Election Day or until any hearing required under State Law with regard to the provisional voter is held, whichever is earlier.

### Voting Machines

The voting systems used in Pennsylvania are optical scan, DRE, and paper ballots.

**Optical Scan:** With this system, you will receive a card or sheet of paper, which you take over to a private table or booth. The card has the names of the candidates and ballot measures printed on it. With a pen or pencil you fill in a little box or circle or the space between two arrows. When you are finished filling out all the cards, you bring the cards over to a ballot box, where poll workers will show you how to put the cards in the box. Or in some places, you may feed the completed cards or papers into a computer device that checks your card or paper right there at the polling place to make sure you have voted the way you want to and counts the votes.

**Direct Recording Electronic (DRE):** All the information about who and what you are voting for is on an electronic screen like a TV or computer screen.

There are many variations of DREs because lots of companies are inventing new ones, and many cities, counties and states are trying them out. Usually, after you have signed in, the poll workers will give you a card that you slide into a device to start your voting session.

Some of these devices will show all of the candidates and ballot choices on one big screen. Often, with these big screen devices you push a button next to the name of the candidate you want to vote for (or yes or no on a ballot measure). On other DREs, the screen is set up to show pages. On each screen or page, there will probably be one thing to vote on. For example, on one screen or page, you might vote for president. Then you might move to the next page to vote for senator. Often these small-screen devices have a touch screen where you touch the screen next to the name of the person you want to vote for. Other devices have a key pad. And some have a keyboard, so you can write in the name of someone you want to vote for.

You let the system know you are finished voting by pushing a button, touching the screen or entering something on a keypad.

**Paper Ballots:** Paper ballots are one of the oldest ways of voting in America. They are still used in a few places on Election Day. When you come to the polling place, you will get a paper ballot from the poll worker. You take it to the voting booth, and use a pen or pencil to mark a box next to your candidate and issue choices. You then drop the marked ballot into a sealed ballot box.

### Voting Machines

The voting system used in South Carolina is DRE.

**Direct Recording Electronic (DRE):** This is the newest kind of system in use in the U.S. All the information about who and what you are voting for is on an electronic screen like a TV or computer screen.

There are many variations of DREs because lots of companies are inventing new ones, and many cities, counties and states are trying them out. Usually, after you have signed in, the poll workers will give you a card that you slide into a device to start your voting session.

Some of these devices will show all of the candidates and ballot choices on one big screen. Often, with these big screen devices you push a button next to the name of the candidate you want to vote for (or yes or no on a ballot measure). On other DREs, the screen is set up to show pages. On each screen or page, there will probably be one thing to vote on. For example, on one screen or page, you might vote for president. Then you might move to the next page to vote for senator. Often these small-screen devices have a touch screen, where you touch the screen next to the name of the person you want to vote for. Other devices have a key pad. And some have a keyboard, so you can write in the name of someone you want to vote for.

You let the system know you are finished voting by pushing a button, touching the screen or entering something on a keypad.

If you are physically unable to mark your ballot, or cannot read the ballot, you are eligible for assistance. You may choose anyone as an assistant except your employer or an officer of your union, or an agent of either. The assistant must take an oath of assistance administered by an election official. The assistant may read the ballot to you and mark your ballot. If you do not choose your own assistant, two election officials (of different political parties in the General Election) may assist you. Poll watchers and inspectors can observe the assistance by election officials.

An interpreter may be used if you and the election official cannot speak the same language. The interpreter must be a registered voter of the county, must take the oath of assistance and may interpret for any number of voters. Under HAVA, all Texas counties must provide one direct electronic voting machine (DRE) at each polling place for use by voters with visual disabilities, so they may cast their ballot without assistance. These machines are equipped with headphones and a keypad.

This location should be where you intend to return after any temporary absence. When you are describing your residence on the voter application, you are making a factual statement to the best of your knowledge and belief. You are presumed under Texas law to be in the best position to make a factual determination concerning where your residence is for registration purposes. However, you cannot register in more than one location; if you register in one county but put another Texas county as your home on the application, your application will be forwarded to the Texas county of your residence.

### Polling Place Hours

On election day the polling place will be open from 7:00 am to 7:00 pm.

### ID Needed for Voter Registration

In order to register to vote you must include your state driver\'s license number or personal ID number issued by the State Department of public Safety on the [application form](https://webservices.sos.state.tx.us/vrapp/index.asp). If you do not have either of these numbers you may provide the last four digits of your social security number on the form. If you don\'t have a social security number you must check the box stating you do not have this information

 

 

### ID Needed for Voting

All citizens wishing to vote must be on the official list of registered voters. Voters may use one of seven forms of photo ID. IDs may be expired up to four years. Persons seventy years of age or older may use an expired ID.

Acceptable forms of ID are:

-   Driver license

-   Texas Election Identification Certificate (EIC)

-   Texas Personal Identification Card issued by DPS

-   Texas license to carry a handgun issued by DPS

-   US military identification card containing the person's photograph

-   US citizenship certificate containing the person's photograph

-   US passport (book or card)

Registered voters without photo ID, who cannot reasonably obtain one, may sign a form and present the original or a copy of one of the following documents with the voters name and address to vote a regular ballot:

-   Voter registration card

-   Certifiedbirthcertificate

-   Current utility bill

-   Bankstatement

-   Government check

-   Paycheck

-   Any other government document such as an out of state driver's license or ex- pired Texas driver's license.

The form is called a "Voter's Declaration of Reasonable Impediment or Difficulty." The voter must mark on the form one of the following reasons for not providing a photo ID.\*

-   Lack of transportation

-   Disability or illness

-   Lack of birth certificate or other documents needed to obtain an acceptable form of photo ID.

-   Work schedule

-   Family responsibilities

-   Lost or stolen identification

-   Acceptable form of photo ID applied for but not received

\*ID address does not have to match the voter registration address.

A student ID is not a form of vailid voter ID.

Once you sign the form and show your ID you will be able to cast a normal ballot at your polling place.

The name on your photo ID and the list of registered voters must match. If your name is substantially similar (if it\'s slightly different, is a common variation of your formal name, contains an initial, middle name or former last name or your first, middle or last name is in a different field on the ID than on the list of registered voters) you may still be able to vote a normal ballot. However, you must also submit an affidavit stating that you are the same person as is listed on the list of registered voters.

If you do not have any of these forms of ID, you can get an Election Identification Certificate to present at the polling place. To find out more about these certificates, [click here.](http://www.dps.texas.gov/DriverLicense/electionID.htm)

If you have further questions on your polling place location, please contact your [county clerk](https://www.overseasvotefoundation.org/vote/election-official-directory).

### Voting Machines

The voting systems used in Texas are optical scan, DRE and paper ballots.

**Optical Scan:** With this system, you will receive a card or sheet of paper, which you take over to a private table or booth. The card has the names of the various candidates and ballot measures printed on it. With a pen or pencil you fill in a little box or circle or the space between two arrows. When you are finished filling out all the cards, you may bring the cards over to a ballot box, where poll workers will show you how to put the cards in the box. Or in some places, you may feed the completed cards or papers into a computer device that checks your card or paper right there at the polling place to make sure you have voted the way you want to and counts the votes.

**Direct Recording Electronic (DRE):** This is the newest kind of system in use in the U.S. All the information about who and what you are voting for is on an electronic screen like a TV or computer screen.

There are many variations of DREs because lots of companies are inventing new ones, and many cities, counties and states are trying them out. Usually, after you have signed in, the poll workers will give you a card that you slide into a device to start your voting session.

Some of these devices will show all of the candidates and ballot choices on one big screen. Often, with these big screen devices you push a button next to the name of the candidate you want to vote for (or yes or no on a ballot measure). On other DREs, the screen is set up to show pages. On each screen or page, there will probably be one thing to vote on. For example, on one screen or page, you might vote for president. Then you might move to the next page to vote for senator. Often these small-screen devices have a touch screen, where you touch the screen next to the name of the person you want to vote for. Other devices have a key pad. And some have a keyboard, so you can write in the name of someone you want to vote for.

You let the system know you are finished voting by pushing a button, touching the screen or entering something on a keypad.

**Paper Ballots:** Paper ballots are one of the oldest ways of voting in America. They are still used in a few places on Election Day. When you come to the polling place, you will get a paper ballot from the poll worker. You take it to the voting booth, and use a pen or pencil to mark a box next to your candidate and issue choices. You then drop the marked ballot into a sealed ballot box.

If you have additional questions about elections and voting overseas you can use our state specific elections official directory or contact the [Overseas Vote Foundation.](https://www.overseasvotefoundation.org/about-contact)

### Provisional Voting

You may vote a provisional ballot if you meet specific conditions. Provisional Ballots are counted between 7-13 days after the election.

You are eligible to vote a provisional ballot if:

-   You claim to be an eligible voter, but your name does not appear on the list of registered voters, and your registration cannot be determined by the voter registrar

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   You have applied for a ballot by mail, but have not returned it or cancelled it with the main early voting clerk
-   You vote during extended polling hours ordered by a state or federal court
-   You are registered, but are attempting to vote in a precinct other than the one in which you are registered
-   You do not present a voter registration certificate or any other acceptable form of identification
-   You are registered in the precinct, but your address is not located in the political subdivision conducting the election
-   You voted in another party\'s primary in the primary election

If you claim to be registered, but your name is not on the list of registered voters, the presiding judge shall call the voter registrar to determine if you are registered. If registration can be confirmed, and you can show identification, you may vote a regular ballot, or be directed to the correct precinct if you are in the wrong precinct. You may vote a provisional ballot, but you must be informed that it will not be counted if:

-   You registered in a different precinct
-   It is indicated on the voter registration list that you voted by mail
-   You have no identification

Provisional voters will receive a notice in the mail by the 10th day after the election letting them know if their provisional ballots were county, and if they were not counted, the reasons why.

Texas does offer a limited ballot, but it is not considered a provisional ballot. Limited ballots are available if you have moved from one Texas county to another and are registered to vote in the former county of residence, but your voter registration in the new county will not be effective by election day due to the 30 day required period between registration and the election. This limited ballot is available only during early voting by personal appearance or by mail. The limited ballot contains only offices or propositions to be voted on statewide, or offices or propositions of territorial units of which you were a resident both before and after your move.

### Provisions for Voters with Disabilities

Polling places must allow all voters to conveniently and privately cast their votes. This means that polling places should be accessible to all voters, including people with physical and mental disabilities, as well as the elderly. If you find a polling place that is not, you should notify the secretary of state\'s office, who will work with the town to ensure that steps are taken to make it accessible. If you have a unique accessibility need, you should give the town reasonable advance notice so that the town can take steps to accommodate your needs.

If you are sick or disabled, you can ask that election officials bring a ballot to your car, as long as the car is next to the polling place. Two election officials will bring the ballot to the car and assist you if you request it, and then they will return to the polling place and place the completed ballot in the ballot box or optical scan machine. All voters have the right to have someone assist them in voting and voters may bring in devices, such as a magnifying glass to help them vote.

If you require assistance and have brought someone with you to help, simply tell the election officials that you have someone to help you with the voting process. The person providing assistance can be anyone of your choosing, as long as the person helping is not your employer or union representative. You should not have to reveal that you have a disability or why you may need assistance. The person helping can do such things as read the ballot to you, help fill out the paper ballots or use the voting machine.

If you need assistance and did not bring someone to the polls to help, two election officials will provide whatever assistance is needed. When you check in to vote, simply tell the election workers that you need assistance. With no questions asked, you must be provided that assistance.

If you spoil a ballot (mark the ballot improperly), or decide to change how you voted before putting the ballot in the ballot box or optical scan machine, you may ask for a new ballot. Every person is allowed to ask for a new ballot, up to three times, but can only cast one vote. If you vote for more than the number of candidates allowed in a particular race, the optical scan machine will reject the ballot to give you the chance to correct the ballot so your votes will count. In towns that count by hand, there will be reminders by the ballot box asking you to check your ballot to correct any over-votes. You can ask for help in putting your ballots into the ballot box or optical scan machine.

The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) required states to implement voting systems that are accessible for individuals with disabilities and permit voters who are blind or visually-impaired to cast their votes privately and independently. The vote-by-phone system purchased by the State of Vermont is designed to meet this mandate. When you go to your polling place and check in at the entrance checklist, indicate that you wish to use the vote-by-phone system. A poll worker uses a designated telephone to call the system, enters the poll worker and ballot access IDs to bring up the appropriate ballot, then gives the phone to you and leaves the voting booth. The system reads the ballot to you and, after you make ballot selections using the telephone key pad, the system prints out a paper ballot at the office of the secretary of state. The paper ballot is automatically scanned and can be played back to you for verification upon your request. You may decide to cast it or discard it and re-vote.

### Voting Machines

The voting systems used in Vermont are optical scan, paper ballots and vote by phone.

**Optical Scan:** With this system, you will receive a card or sheet of paper, which you take over to a private table or booth. The card has the names of the various candidates and ballot measures printed on it. With a pen or pencil you fill in a little box or circle or the space between two arrows. When you are finished filling out all the cards, you may bring the cards over to a ballot box, where poll workers will show you how to put the cards in the box. Or in some places, you may feed the completed cards or papers into a computer device that checks your card or paper right there at the polling place to make sure you have voted the way you want to and counts the votes.

**Paper Ballots:** Paper ballots are one of the oldest ways of voting in America. They are still used in a few places on Election Day. When you come to the polling place, you will get a paper ballot from the poll worker. You take it to the voting booth, and use a pen or pencil to mark a box next to your candidate and issue choices. You then drop the marked ballot into a sealed ballot box.

**Vote by Phone:** The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) required states to implement voting systems that are accessible for individuals with disabilities and permit voters who are blind or visually-impaired to cast their votes privately and independently. The vote-by-phone system purchased by the State of Vermont is designed to meet this mandate. When you go to your polling place and check in at the entrance checklist, indicate that you wish to use the vote-by-phone system. A poll worker uses a designated telephone to call the system, enters the poll worker and ballot access IDs to bring up the appropriate ballot, then gives the phone to you and leaves the voting booth. The system reads the ballot to you and, after you makes ballot selections using the telephone key pad, the system prints out a paper ballot at the office of the secretary of state. The paper ballot is automatically scanned and can be played back to you for verification upon your request. You may decide to cast it or discard it and revote.

The vote by phone system permits you to practice voting on the system prior to Election Day. You will be able to use any touchtone telephone to call into the system and practice voting to familiarize yourself with the contests and candidates on your ballot. To try out the system and practice voting your ballot, call your [local county clerk](https://www.overseasvotefoundation.org/vote/election-official-directory) to get the ballot access 3 digit \# for your voting district. Then call (866) 486-3838 to listen and practice voting on the same ballot that you will hear and vote on Election Day. You can call in and practice as many times as you want.

All phone calls are answered by a computer system located at a secure location controlled by authorized election officials. The computer will only permit access to the system from phone numbers that have been entered into the system prior to the election, and only after the proper poll worker and ballot access ID numbers have been entered. The vote-by-phone system will be pre-tested before every election to ensure accurate programming. The system makes no use of the Internet or any other data network, so the system cannot be hacked. The only system input comes from DTMF tones, the distinct sounds generated by the telephone when its buttons are pressed. The vote-by-phone system produces a voter-verified paper ballot for every vote cast and the process can be monitored by observers.

You can learn more about voting systems by checking out the [Elections Assistance Commission\'s (EAC) resource.](http://www.eac.gov/testing_and_certification/voluntary_voting_system_guidelines.aspx)

### Voting Machines

The voting systems used in West Virginia are Optical Scan, AutoMARK, Paper Ballots and DRE.

**Optical Scan:** An optical scan ballot is a specially designed paper ballot which is marked by the voter with a special pencil, then tallied by a computer reader. The layout is very similar to the standardized tests given in school, the voter darkens an oval next to a candidate\'s name in order to enter a vote.

**AutoMARK**:This voting system actually uses the Optical Scan ballot. The voter inserts the ballot into the machine and uses the AutoMARK touch screen to make his/her choices; when the voter is finished, the unit then marks the ballot for the voter and the voter retrieves his/her ballot and places it in a ballot box.

**Paper Ballots:** Paper Ballots are still marked with an x to select the preferred candidate and then counted at the polling place by a team of five election officials called a Counting Board.

**Direct Recording Electronic (DRE):** This is the newest kind of system in use in the U.S. All the information about who and what you are voting for is on an electronic screen like a TV or computer screen.

There are many variations of DREs because lots of companies are inventing new ones, and many cities, counties and states are trying them out. Usually, after you have signed in, the poll workers will give you a card that you slide into a device to start your voting session.

Some of these devices will show all of the candidates and ballot choices on one big screen. Often, with these big screen devices you push a button next to the name of the candidate you want to vote for (or yes or no on a ballot measure). On other DREs, the screen is set up to show pages. On each screen or page, there will probably be one thing to vote on. For example, on one screen or page, you might vote for president. Then you might move to the next page to vote for senator. Often these small-screen devices have a touch screen, where you touch the screen next to the name of the person you want to vote for. Other devices have a key pad. And some have a keyboard, so you can write in the name of someone you want to vote for. You let the system know you are finished voting by pushing a button, touching the screen or entering something on a keypad.

You can learn more about voting systems by checking out the [Elections Assistance Commission\'s (EAC) resource.](http://www.eac.gov/testing_and_certification/voluntary_voting_system_guidelines.aspx)

### Provisions for Voters with Disabilities

Wisconsin ensures that voting be accessible for individuals with disabilities, including non-visual accessibility for the blind and visually impaired, in a manner that provides equal access and participation (including privacy and independence).

Any voter who needs help at the polls has a right to assistance. By law, a polling place must be accessible to a person with disabilities. It is a good idea to check the accessibility of the polling place ahead of time. You may find the building not accessible or have trouble getting to the polling location inside the building. If so, you may request that a poll worker bring a ballot to the building entrance or bring a friend along to assist you. If your polling place is not accessible, notify your city, town or village clerk\'s office and the Wisconsin Elections Commission.

You can have help casting your ballot if you have problems reading or writing, have difficulty with the English language or have a disability which prevents you from being able to mark the ballot or operate the voting machine. Ask for help when you give your name and address to the poll worker. Anyone you choose can help you, except your employer, an agent of your employer, or (if you belong to a labor union), an agent of your labor union. The person who is helping you must give his name and address to the poll workers and must sign the back of your ballot.

For help with disability-related voting questions or help filing a complaint, please call the Disability Rights Wisconsin Voter Hotline: 844-DIS-VOTE (844-347-8683).

The voting systems used in Wisconsin are optical scan, DRE, and paper ballots.

**Optical Scan:** With this system, you will receive a card or sheet of paper, which you take to a private table or booth. The card has the names of the various candidates and ballot measures printed on it. With a pen or pencil you fill in a little box or circle or the space between two arrows. When you are finished filling out all the cards, you may bring the cards over to a ballot box, where poll workers will show you how to put the cards in the box. Or in some places, you may feed the completed cards or papers into a computer device that checks your card or paper right there at the polling place to make sure you have voted the way you want to and counts the votes.

**Direct Recording Electronic (DRE):** This is the newest kind of system in use in the U.S. All the information about who and what you are voting for is on an electronic screen like a TV or computer screen.

There are many variations of DREs because lots of companies are inventing new ones, and many cities, counties and states are trying them out. Usually, after you have signed in, the poll workers will give you a card that you slide into a device to start your voting session.

And some have a keyboard, so you can write in the name of someone you want to vote for.

You let the system know you are finished voting by pushing a button, touching the screen or entering something on a keypad.

**Paper Ballots:** Paper ballots are one of the oldest ways of voting in America. They are still used in a few places on Election Day. When you come to the polling place, you will get a paper ballot from the poll worker. You take it to the voting booth, and use a pen or pencil to mark a box next to your candidate and issue choices. You then drop the marked ballot into a sealed ballot box.

### Voting Machines

The voting systems used in Wyoming are optical scan and DRE.

**Optical Scan:** With this system, you will receive a card or sheet of paper, which you take over to a private table or booth. The card has the names of the various candidates and ballot measures printed on it. With a pen or pencil you fill in a little box or circle or the space between two arrows. When you are finished filling out all the cards, you may bring the cards over to a ballot box, where poll workers will show you how to put the cards in the box. Or in some places, you may feed the completed cards or papers into a computer device that checks your card or paper right there at the polling place to make sure you have voted the way you want to and counts the votes.

**Direct Recording Electronic (DRE):** This is the newest kind of system in use in the U.S. All the information about who and what you are voting for is on an electronic screen like a TV or computer screen.

There are many variations of DREs because lots of companies are inventing new ones, and many cities, counties and states are trying them out. Usually, after you have signed in, the poll workers will give you a card that you slide into a device to start your voting session.

Some of these devices will show all of the candidates and ballot choices on one big screen. Often, with these big screen devices you push a button next to the name of the candidate you want to vote for (or yes or no on a ballot measure). On other DREs, the screen is set up to show pages. On each screen or page, there will probably be one thing to vote on. For example, on one screen or page, you might vote for president. Then you might move to the next page to vote for senator. Often these small-screen devices have a touch screen, where you touch the screen next to the name of the person you want to vote for. Other devices have a key pad. And some have a keyboard, so you can write in the name of someone you want to vote for.

You let the system know you are finished voting by pushing a button, touching the screen or entering something on a keypad.

You can learn more about voting systems by checking out the [Elections Assistance Commission\'s (EAC) resource.](http://www.eac.gov/testing_and_certification/voluntary_voting_system_guidelines.aspx)
