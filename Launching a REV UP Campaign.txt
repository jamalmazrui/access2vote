Launching a REV UP Campaign

Register! Educate! Vote! Use your Power!
The REV UP Campaign is an initiative of the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD). AAPD is a convener, connector, and catalyst for change, increasing the political and economic power of people with disabilities.
 
The REV UP Campaign, which launched in early 2016, engages in nonpartisan activities to increase the political power of the disability community while also engaging candidates and the media on disability issues. REV UP stands for Register! Educate! Vote! Use your Power! REV UP helps organize the disability community at the state and local level to get more people with disabilities registered to vote and involved in the political process. It also raises the national profile of the disability community as an influential voting bloc.
 
 
Statistics
*         People with disabilities will account for 35.4 million eligible voters in 2016, approximately one sixth of the total electorate (Rutgers University).
*         In 2016, there will be 62.7 million eligible voters who either have a disability or have a household member with a disability, more than one-fourth of the total electorate (Rutgers University).
*         In 2016, the number people with disabilities who are eligible to vote will surpass the number of eligible Black and Latino voters (USA Today).
*         In 2012, 56.8% of people with disabilities voted compared to 62.5% of people without disabilities.
*         If people with disabilities voted at the same rate as people without disabilities in 2012 there would have been an additional 3 million votes cast.
*         In 2012, 30 percent of people with disabilities reported difficulty in voting, compared with 8 percent of people without disabilities (Rutgers University).

 
REV UP 2016 - Accomplishments To Date
 
Mobilizing the Grassroots Disability Community

Short- and Long-Term Objectives
The REV UP Campaign will continue beyond the 2016 elections. Our intent is to grow the campaign to increase the political power of people with disabilities and influence election outcomes and policy decision-making at all levels of government.
 
In 2017 and beyond the REV UP Campaign aims to:
*         Establish REV UP State Voting Coalitions, composed of state and local leaders representing the cross-disability community, to lead the effort to increase the political participation of people with disabilities across their state. Representatives from each REV UP State Voting Coalition will connect with one another via conference calls and other opportunities organized by AAPD to share resources, strategies, and ideas with one another.
*         Advocate to protect and expand voting rights to ensure voters with disabilities are not disenfranchised.
*         Work with protection and advocacy agencies to utilize funding from the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) for their voter engagement activities.
*         Lobby Secretaries of State across the country to get disability status included in the demographic data collected as part of the voter file.
*         Target a specific state or local election in 2017 with direct voter registration and Get-Out-The-Vote efforts to measure and demonstrate the disability community's organizing impact.
*         Build out the REV UP website to better share information about state resources and events.
*         Host recurring conference calls (monthly or quarterly) to connect advocates across the country to share information and resources.
*         Arrange in-person meetings at various national disability conferences to connect advocates across the country to share information and resources.

Plan Activities
How you engage with REV UP is up to you and the needs of your community. Here are a few ideas to consider:
*         Participate in National Disability Voter Registration Week
*         Host a voter registration and education event
*         Host a town hall meeting with state/local elected officials or candidates for office
*         Host an educational meeting or workshop with local election officials
*         Utilize your mail, email, and social media networks to provide information on voter registration and relevant disability issues in your area while also encouraging people to commit to vote on Election Day. View sample social media posts.
*         Send letters to candidates about the issues that are important to people with disabilities in your community
*         Include REV UP and voter registration tables at upcoming events (especially any events around the 26th anniversary of the ADA).
*         Write letters to the editor or Op-Eds and engage local radio or TV stations on the growing efforts by the disability community to become an influential voice in electoral politics this November and beyond.
*         Make your organization a polling place (Resources: How To Serve As A Polling Site and ADA Polling Place Checklist).
 
 
 
 

 
How We Organized - REV UP Texas
Written by Bob Kafka
The last election for Texas Governor generated a lot of interest in the disability community because the Republican candidate, Greg Abbott, uses a wheelchair for mobility and the Democratic candidate, Wendy Davis, had attracted national attention because of her filibustering an anti-choice piece of legislation.
ADAPT of Texas, a 501 c 3 non-profit organization, called a meeting that brought together all the disability/family state/local organizations in Texas. We organized under the name of Texas Disability Issues Forum - TDIF (to avoid turf issues).
TDIF was non-partisan because most of the coalition members were 501 c 3 organizations.
This coalition of organizations included organizations representing all disabilities regardless of age - parent advocacy groups as well as providers. We decided to do two things: 1. Develop a candidate survey, and 2. Hold an issues forum inviting candidates from both parties for the offices of Governor, Lt. Governor, and Attorney General. Over 300 people attended the Issues Forum.
REV UP Texas came about after the Governors election.
ADAPT of Texas got together with Disability Rights Texas (the Texas protection and advocacy agency) and called another meeting of the same groups that organized TDIF. At this meeting we decided to continue our Disability Voting Coalition under the name REV UP Texas. We found out that many groups had excellent information and we integrated that information into the REV UP Texas Toolkit that compiled all that information in one place. Since Texas is such a big state we outreached to get REV UP representatives in various locations in Texas. Since we had few resources we relied on people's enthusiasm to keep the REV UP Texas name in front of the public and legislators. The 2016 election kept the REV UP Texas momentum going and we participated in voter registration campaigns, education forums on disability issues, and Get Out the Disability Vote Campaigns.
A major benefit of organizing under the name REV UP Texas is that we now are recognized (branded) as the Disability Voting Coalition that folks can go to for good information.
Many years ago I was told campaigns wants lists that they can outreach to. Generally, our lists are small. It dawned on me if we could get the state list of people who have disabled tags for their/family car and the Paratransit lists we would have a high percentage of our states disability population.
REV UP Texas submitted a Public Information request to the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles (TDMV). We asked for name, address, phone number, and e-mail of individuals with disability plates for their car. In Texas only the phone numbers are public information. For $137.00 we got 1.2 million phone numbers. We then matched those phone numbers to the voter registration list and found out that 650,000 of those 1.2 million folks had voted. We are now looking for resources to break into this data further. We are also exploring getting disability listed on Voter Registration Cards.

How REVUP MA Was Organized in Massachusetts
 
Written by Christine Griffin & Charlie Carr
 
With the uncertain times ahead, now more than ever, we need to continue organizing people with disabilities to register, educate and vote and use your power. Change happens first on the local level; REVUP MA is reaching out to people with disabilities throughout the Commonwealth, getting them to register and vote regardless of party affiliation.
REVUP MA started in the summer of 2015 when the state P&A, the Disability Law Center (DLC) convened a small group of advocates to discuss the formation of a statewide voting task force.  This group discussed how to begin work necessary to increase voter registration and to continue the work DLC funded to eliminate barriers to voting that would be anticipated in a presidential election year.   As a result of that meeting, DLC began organizing a daylong conference that would bring a statewide group of people with disabilities together to talk about how to organize our communities to work together on voter education, registration and voting.  
Prior to that event, DLC's Executive Director who is also the President of the AAPD Board, worked with the AAPD's Executive Director and Bob Kafka to discuss what Bob and other advocates were doing in Texas with their REV UP! campaign.  We all agreed that this would make a great national campaign that AAPD could lead and that we would attempt to get other states, like Massachusetts, to begin a state REV UP! campaign.
DLC organized and held the first REV UP! MA event in November 2015 to plan for the work necessary to increase registration and voting opportunities for people with disabilities.  This event attracted more than 100 people including staff from Independent Living Centers, MA Developmental Disabilities Council, and a wide variety of individuals and organizations working with people with all disabilities.  We had several panels, one with Jim Dickson and Michelle Bishop as well as another panel consisting of Bob Kafka, Stephanie Thomas. Jima and Michelle discussed grass roots organizing while Bob and Stephanie talked extensively about REVUP, the Texas-based organization they created that was doing voter registration, education and helping people understand how voting as a bloc can make a measurable difference in the quality of our lives.  Bob and Stephanie also discussed ideas about how to engage potential voters with disabilities that were not registered to vote.  
The outcome of this meeting became the framework for REVUP MA and we got to work developing a website to use as a marketing and education tool as well as a database to capture contact info from anyone interested in our campaign.  
We began seeking opportunities immediately to spread the word about REV UP MA and a smaller group continued to meet and plan.   DLC hosted a meeting with the Chairman of the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) in December 2015 which resulted in the EAC deciding to hold a Commission meeting on barriers to voting and access for voters with disabilities in Boston.  DLC and the REV UP Team assisted the EAC in finding panelists for the various panels they wanted for their meeting.  DLC also organized and planned the second REV UP MA statewide meeting after the Commission meeting to continue our planning activities. 
We invited Ted Jackson who gave an excellent presentation on building electoral power and voting accessibility. Attendees were both people and organizations represented at the first meeting and more diverse groups like LGBTQ and youth who also wanted to be heard.
REVUP MA went from conceptual framework to blueprint for implementation after this meeting, creating goals for registrations and committing to attend all the events we could to further educate the community and others about the importance of the disability vote.   Over the next 6 months, statewide voter registration drives were held at many local disability organizations, ADA celebrations, and events.  DLC hired a young leader in the community to attend as many events as possible to increase voter registration and to obtain signed pledges to vote. During this period over 400 people with disabilities signed pledges to vote. 
REVUP MA continued to share important information via the website and two cable TV shows on how to register to vote, as well as information about early registration that was allowed for the first time in Massachusetts during the presidential election.  DLC also wrote a proclamation that Governor Baker signed declaring of week of July 11-15, 2016 as Massachusetts Disability Voter Registration Week.  
As Election Day approached, the REV UP MA Team also put out positive messages through the website and social media about voter registration and the importance of voting as well as information on who to call if you ran into a barrier on Election Day.  
DLC contracted with 8 Independent Living Centers, as they do every Election Day, to conduct barrier surveys at more than a hundred polling places all over the state.  
Regardless of who your candidate was, unsubstantiated data suggest that people with disabilities voted in greater number than previous years. If this is true, we can attribute the change to REVUP MA and its grassroots driven focus on improved voter registration and voting outcomes in the disability community. 
DLC funded 99% of all REV UP MA activities and marketing tools with PAVA funding and will continue to do so going forward.
