How To Serve As A Polling Site
 
A great way to participate in the voting process and have an active role in your community is to have your building serve as polling place for your county, city, state, and federal elections.
There are buildings that the elections office will designate to serve as a polling site, but as a community member, you may also suggest a location or volunteer your location.

Step 1: Have the discussion with your supervisors, etc., about the idea of using your location as a polling site. Who would be the point of contact; could you be a polling site for the entire early voting and election day period [research the time period for early voting in your state, if applicable]; could your building stay open during voting times [research voting hours for your state]; who would open and close your building; is your building ADA accessible; does serving as a polling place conflict with any potential funding?
Step 2: Once you get approval from everyone, contact your county elections office and ask to speak with someone about become a polling place.
*         The county will want to come by to inspect your building for ADA accessibility and also to see where the actual voting will occur.
o   If your location does not pass ADA accessibility standards, see if there are some temporary solutions that may be implemented during election times.
o   What needs to be done to solve accessibility issues and is there a time frame?
Step 3: The county elections office will put your location into their system and voting schedule. Election staff will let you know if they are going to use your location.  Once contacted, you may also receive the polling place schedule (dates, times your location will be used).
Step 4: Make sure these assigned date(s) do not conflict with any other events occurring at your location. If there are no scheduling conflicts, make arrangements to ensure the space will be used only for voting during the planned dates.
*         Confirm dates (if needed) with elections office.
*         If you have a front desk/reception area and maintenance team, share the assigned dates with them so they can be aware of what is going on and make any kind of preparations.
Step 5: One to two weeks before the event, the elections office may contact you with poll worker contact information and to confirm polling place dates.  
*         If this does not happen, call the elections office to confirm dates and offer your contact information to the poll worker(s)/precinct judge that will be at your location.
Step 6: 2-3 days before, remind staff that this building will be a polling site, so they should expect higher foot traffic and perhaps increased parking.  If necessary, ask staff to park on one side of parking lot to accommodate the need for voter parking. Also, if applicable, remind staff to put away personal possessions from view of general public.
 
 
General tips:
*         You do not need to work as a poll worker. The county will provide their own poll workers. The county will also set up everything and take it all down. You just need to provide the space.
*         This is a great outreach opportunity.  Every place that serves as a polling site receives voter asking about the location's services/business.
*         Let the poll workers know you are happy they are here! Show them where the bathrooms are; where they can put their lunch, etc. Make sure your location's Point of Contact is available for any questions they many have.
*         Share information with your network about when your location will be a polling place.
*         If you want to be a polling place again, send your county contact a thank you letter and tell them you want to participate again.
